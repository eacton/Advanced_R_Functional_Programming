#Advanced R: Functional Programming

These are the slides I created for the R Study Group http://minisciencegirl.github.io/studyGroup/ lesson for March 8, 2017.

This is the *Advanced R: Functional Programming* lesson, the object of which was to discuss and address exercises as the R Study Group goes through Hadley's http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html.
